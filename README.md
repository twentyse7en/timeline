# Timeline

## Motivation
I just want something like twitter, save my thoughts or some notes I have in mind. Small pieces of thoughts, writing journal at the end of the day didn' work for me. I wish I could write journal, but I never write those practically.
So I thought save when ever that arises.

## Scope
Minimal functionality

1. Save thought with tags
2. view all thoughts
3. Filter based on tags

These where minimum functionalities I had in mind to get started.

## Future
1. Pagination (view by each day)
2. Edit and Delete posts
3. clean code

## Note
Code might be not following go best practices. I'm learning go and will improve the code on the way.
